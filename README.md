# OCTAforESRD

This project explores the use of fundus microvascular features obtained through noninvasive optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to predict treatment outcomes, complications, and all-cause mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. By leveraging machine learning models, we aim to provide an innovative and reliable tool for real-time assessment and risk prediction in dialysis patients, facilitating timely interventions and improving long-term prognosis.

## Features
- Identification of retina and choroid microvascular characteristics associated with treatment indicators and prognosis.
- Analysis of vessel density and thickness in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.
- Development of multimodal machine learning models integrating OCTA and clinical data.
- Prediction of dialysis adequacy, anemia and Hypoalbuminemia before dialysis sessions.
- Reliable prediction of intradialytic hypotension complications and 2-year all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients.
